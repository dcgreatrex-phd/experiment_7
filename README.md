# Overview:

Experiment 7 expands the investigation beyond perceptual decision making to test whether rhythmic temporal expectations bias subjective value representations. This is the last unexplored feature of the new experimental approach described in chapter 3 and is key to expanding the generalisability of the thesis to everyday decision making. A large proportion of everyday decision making is concerned with not only the detection and identification of a stimulus (as in experiments 1 - 6), but predictions about the benefits of outcomes that are yet to be experienced. Understanding, therefore, whether the presentational timing of a stimulus biases the attractiveness of options will afford new insights into the effects of expectation and timing on choice. Most previous research into subjective value is associated with tasks in which participants make preference decisions between items of food. Experiment 7, in contrast, used non-appetitive audio-visual stimuli relating to music in order to increase the generalisability and ecological validity of value-based decision making research.
Thus experiment 7 was designed with three aims in mind:
- To determine whether rhythmic temporal expectations bias subjective value representations.
- To explore whether results from the literature on subjective value generalise to non-appetitive stimuli, specifically musical preferences.
- To test whether preference decisions associated with music are any different to those associated with tangible substances such as food.
